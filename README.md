# MyShows MCP Server

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the `myshows.me` API. It allows you to connect agents to your MyShows profile to manage and search for TV shows.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via environment variables. You must set your `myshows.me` credentials before running the server.

## MCP configuration
```json
{
  /// The name of your MCP server
  "myshows": {
    /// The command which runs the MCP server
    "command": "uvx",
    /// The arguments to pass to the MCP server
    "args": ["--from","git+https://github.com/zeloras/myshows_mcp.git","myshows_mcp"],
    /// The environment variables to set
    "env": {"MYSHOWS_LOGIN":"login","MYSHOWS_PASSWORD":"pwd"}
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

*   `search_shows(query: str, year: int = None, page: int = 0)`: Searches for TV shows by name and optional year.
